# GERLIE-Game-Engine
My own Game Engine made in C++ and WPF UI. GERLIE stands for Game Engine for Realistic and Lifelike Immersion and Environment.

# Progress

## 25 Sep 2023
- At last, I learned how to upload my code to GitHub. I also reworked the entire project because of bad variables I used during the process. Added comprehensive comments.

## 24 Sep 2023
- Done with the launcher UI. Now working with the main page UI. I still don't know how to upload repositories automatically from VB LOL!

## 23 Sep 2023
- I am almost done with the initial UI where user can create or retrieve a project.
